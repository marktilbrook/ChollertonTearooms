    <h2><u>Security Considerations</u></h2>
    <p>This website has one major area of security to focus on. That is the protection of the customers data when using the Form page. This
    page allows customers/users to enter their personal data which is saved onto Chollerton's system. Therefore, customers need to firstly be
    informed that this data will be saved into the system and that their data will be protected. To do this, Chollerton employees who are
    working with the database and personal data must follow the UK GDP Regulations. This data must be kept within the business, not shared
    with third parties, and when the data is no longer needed, it must be removed from the system. Below is a general(but more in depth) guide to the GDPR.
    Also, it is recommended that their is a single administrator who has access to the database, this ensures that their is only one person responsible for
    retrieving customer details. This reduces the risk of incorrect database management such as changing details by accident or deleting records.</p>
